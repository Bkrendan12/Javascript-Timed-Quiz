# Javascript-Timed-Quiz

Project title

Timed-Javascript-Quiz

Motivation

I was tasked to give a user to the opportunity to put their Java Script knowledge to the test. Here, I have built a short timed quiz with each question pertaining to javascript specifically and once the time runs out or the user completes all questions to their best 
ability, the quiz will clear and you will be able to store your results with your name and later if you would like to take the quiz again, you can compare the results from other attempts. Short, fun and visually pleasing!

How to use?

This is a timed quiz on the subject Javascript.

When the user loads the page, you are greeted with a container where the quiz questions and choices will be. It is timed, So you will have a total of 30 seconds to complete the quiz. There are 4 questions in total, all pertaining to javascript. 

When you click on the start button, the timer will start counting down from 30 and your first question will appear with the option of 4 choices to choose from. Each question you answer correctly, your score will be incremented by 1. Each time you answer incorrectly, 5 seconds will be deducted from your time. If the time runs out before you can finish, you won't be given the opportunity to answer the remaining questions, so be sharp and think as quikcly as you can.

Once the quiz is finished whether you answered all the available questions or the time has run out, you will be prompted to give a user name. If you don't type a username, you will be alerted to use some sort of user name or you wont be able to store your results in the highscore window. Once you enter your name, press submit and you will be brought to the high scores window where you can compare previous quiz attempts.

Contribute: 

If anything, this application is pretty polished, but I'd like to avoid users using any numbers as thir name for the highscores and I'd like to add more questions which will result in increasing the time the user will have to complete the questions.

If you would like to do the same, youre welcome to use this as starter code.
